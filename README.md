# Hain-ly: Food Inventory Management System (FIMS)

## 📦 Overview

Food spoilage, contamination, and waste are global issues that threaten health, safety, and sustainability. In the Philippines, poor food handling and lack of inventory tracking lead to millions of tonnes of household food waste annually.

**Hain-ly** aims to tackle this problem by providing a simple and effective **Food Inventory Management System (FIMS)**. This project helps users monitor food stock, track expiration dates, and receive timely reminders — ultimately reducing waste and encouraging smarter food consumption at home.
